1. Open PBI Desktop, Open the given PBIX file
2. Go to Table View-> Ensure all tables having proper shape
3. Go to Model View--> look at one by one dimension column with emp table, if values match, then connect.

	At the time of age group table, there is no direct match, hence we need to create a new column in employee table
	and then join with agegroup table.

	Emp Table->right click->new column-> write the below expression
	AGeGroupID=switch(True, Employee[Age]<=31,1,Employee[Age]<=40,2,Employee[Age]<=150,3)

	Connect this column with AgeGroupId in AgeGroup table [model view]

	Formula explanation:
	COnditional evaluation in DAX: If (single condition) and Switch (multiple conditions)
	True: Bypasses the condition always
	Switch returns result after first match.

4. Create Calculated MEasures and Columns for the new hires analysis

	Emp table-> New column->write the below formula

	 isNewHire = IF(YEAR([date]) = YEAR([HireDate]) && MONTH([date])=MONTH([HireDate]), 1)

	Note: Ensure the column is having only Blanks and 1 values

5. Create new table for all measures
	
	Home menu->New Table->CLick grid, take one column and table name: New Hires Analysis->Ok

	Go to New Hires Analysis table and create one by one measure like below:


	New Hires analysis table-> New measure
			New Hires = SUM(Employee[isNewHire])

	New Hires analysis table-> New measure

			New Hires SPLY = CALCULATE([New Hires],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))

	New Hires analysis table-> New measure

			New Hires YoY Var = [New Hires]-[New Hires SPLY]

	New Hires analysis table-> New measure
		New Hires YoY % Change = DIVIDE([New Hires YoY Var], [New Hires SPLY])


	New Hires analysis table-> New measure
		EmpCount = CALCULATE(COUNT(Employee[EmplID]), FILTER(ALL('Date'[PeriodNumber]), 'Date'[PeriodNumber] = MAX('Date'[PeriodNumber])))

	New Hires analysis table-> New measure	

	Actives = CALCULATE([EmpCount], FILTER(Employee, ISBLANK(Employee[TermDate])))

	New Hires analysis table-> New measure	
	Actives SPLY = CALCULATE([Actives], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))

	New Hires analysis table-> New measure
		Actives YoY Var = [Actives]-[Actives SPLY]

	New Hires analysis table-> New measure
		Actives YoY % Change = DIVIDE([Actives YoY Var], [Actives SPLY])


Note: Remove the EID column, so that measure group table identified seperately

6. Go to Report view

	Take a textbox and specify "New Hires Analysis" [Insert menu->Textbox]

	a) Take two slicers with slicer style as Dropdown
		One for Year and Another one for Month

	b) Take Line and CLustered Column Chart

		X Axis: Month
		COlumn Y-Axis: New Hires, New Hires SPLY
		Line Y-Axis: New Hires YoY Var
		ToolTip:	Year --> Maximum, Qtr

		General Section-> Visual Border ON
	c) Line Chart
		X Axis: Month Name
		Y Axis: New Hires
		Legend: FP Desc
		
		Note: It now shows Full time and Part time individual new hires trend analysis

		Multiple measures (Y and Secondary Y) or multiple categories (Legend) only possible, bot not combo.


	d)Pie Chart
		Legend: Gender table Gender column
		Values: New Hires
		Note: Ensure Gender table ID connected Employee table Gender Column
		SLicer year and verify the values

	e) Go to BU Table--> New COlumn->
			Region = mid(BU[RegionSeq],3,len(BU[RegionSeq])-2)

			Mid: Will bring middle characters from the specicifed posuition to the length given
	
				mid("1-North",3, 7-2)=mid("1-North",3,5)

		Note: In the Power Query level, we can use split to split the information, still I would like to show DAX
			usage, hence this example.

		
		Take Line and Stacked Column Chart
			X Axis: Region from BU table
			Y Axis: NEw Hires
			Line Y-Axis: Actives YoY Var
			Legend: Ethnicity

		Note: Slice Year and Month and see the result

	f) Take Waterfall chart
		Category: AgeGroup
		BreakDown: Year
		Y-Axis: New Hires



	g) Go to each visual, general section, title : Keep a meaningful title so that users will understand easily
